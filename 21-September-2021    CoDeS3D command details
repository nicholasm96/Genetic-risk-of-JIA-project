CoDeS3D command details :

1. Activate the dev conda environment:

conda activate /mnt/projects/users/tfad334/codes3d/codes3d-v2/envs/codes3d_env/
--> This is developer version.. since the --multi-test tissue command is still new/have not been added to the public version

 

2. Run your job:

python /mnt/projects/users/tfad334/codes3d/codes3d-v2/codes3d/codes3d.py -s <path/toSNPs> -o <path/to/output> --multi-test tissue 
 
3. Deactivate environment:
conda deactivate

*Note : to activate initialise conda, you need to do this first --> conda init


- The input file is the 147 SNPs associated with JIA taken from GWAS catalog in txt file
 located here : home/npud380/research_dir/JIA_SNPs/JIA_SNP_rsIDs.txt

- Output directory is : home/npud380/research_dir/JIA_CoDeS3D_run_2


the --multi-test tissue command is to make the multiple test correction to per-tissue basis instead of all tissues.
Therefore we get P-value as if we run CoDeS3D for each tissue separately instead of together.
This reduce the multiple testing burden..
